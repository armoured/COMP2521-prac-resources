Question 5 ... COMP1927 13s1 Final Exam

A.

Operation             State of Queue after operation
                      [highest priority ... lowest priority]

initially             -
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'X')   start -> X
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'A')   start -> A X
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'J')   start -> A J X
PQueueLeave(PQ)       start-> J X
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'K')   start -> J K X
PQueueLeave(PQ)       start -> K X
PQueueLeave(PQ)       start -> X


B.

Firstly a typedef of the type of value used would be useful.
for example, we could typedef an int by saying typedef int Item.
Once we have this item we can implement the queue/stack as a priority
queue with our abstracted Item type. With this Item we would be able
to write a compare function that determines which Item has a higher or
lower value and based on that value decide which Item has more
priority. The priority queue would have the same implementation
as the stack or queue with functions such as join, leave, create
and destroy but we will change the join function to account
for the Item priority.
